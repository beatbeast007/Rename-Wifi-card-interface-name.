Type "sudo su"
(enter root password if prompted.)

Open location, type: "/etc/udev/rules.d/"

Create a new file, type: "touch 70-persistent-net.rules"

Add this:
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="00:01:02:03:04:05", ATTR{dev_id}=="0x0", ATTR{type}=="1", NAME="wlan0"
Reboot

*Be sure to change 00:01:02:03:04:05 to the proper MAC address of your wireless device. This should give you what you need.
